        <h1>Understanding CSS positioning</h1>
        <p><em>Absolute positioning</em> takes an element out of the document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the elemnt has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move as if it was never there. The position of the element is then fixed relative to the top level of the conainer or the closestnparent with a set positioning.</p>
